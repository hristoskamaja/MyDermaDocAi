translation.py

Auto-translates the Macedonian text an admin types for a SkinCondition
(description/symptoms/treatment_overview) into English via Gemini, so the
web/mobile apps can show either language without the admin ever typing the
same content twice. Called from core/views.py right after a condition is
created or one of those three fields changes.

Deliberately a separate, self-contained call (not shared with
analyses/services/gemini_service.py) - core and analyses are independent
Django apps and this is a much simpler, single-purpose prompt (plain
translation, no JSON schema, no recommendation/chat safety rules).

IMPORTANT (free-tier quota): the Gemini free tier is limited to just 5
requests/minute and 20/day for this model. fill_missing_translations()
therefore batches ALL fields that need translating into ONE Gemini call
(JSON in, JSON out) instead of one call per field - a condition has up to
3 translatable fields, so this is up to 3x fewer requests per admin save.
